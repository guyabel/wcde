Download data from the [Wittgenstein Human Capital Data Explorer](http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/wcde-v2/) into R

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of wcder from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("wcder") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Install the developmental version with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("guyabel/wcder", ref = "main")
```

## Example

Download data based on a measure, scenario and country code:

```{r example}
library(wcder)

# SSP2 education specific tfr for Austria and Bulgaria
wcde(indicator = "etfr", country_code = c(40, 100))

# SSP1 and SSP2 education specific tfr for Austria and United Kingdom (guessing the country codes)
wcde(scenario = c(1, 2), indicator = "etfr", country_name = c("Austria", "UK"))

# Not Run
# SSP1 population by education for all countries
# library(dplyr)
# wic_locations %>%
#   filter(dim == "country") %>%
#   pull(isono) %>%
#   wcde(scenario = 1, measure = "epop", country_code = ., include_scenario_names = TRUE)
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
